# Lecture 5 HTML Content Models
Content Model refers to the full behavior the browser applies to elements of the model and to nesting rules of those elements
<br>
i.e which elements are allowed to be nested inside which other elements.
<br>
Prior to HTML5, elements were either Block Level or Inline Level.
<br>
HTML5 split these into 7 more models
<br>
Block Level
- Render begins on a new line by default, every time a block level element is specfied, it is rednered on a new line
- May containt inline or other block-lvl elmnts
- DIV element

<br>
Inline Elements
-  Render on the same line by default, bunch of ILEs will all go on the same line
- May only contain other InLine elmts, cant hold blck lvl elmts.
- SPAN element

HTML 5 has more complex content catagories, Flow Content and Phrasing Content
